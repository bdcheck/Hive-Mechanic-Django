This folder is intended to be a package that can be loaded onto a Raspberry Pi. For this reason,
there are duplicates of the "init.py", "client.py", and "local_settings.py" Hive Mechanic scripts.

History:
December 2020 -- creating new example with Raspberry Pi... our first with the new Python Client
for Hive.

January 2021 -- successful tests with "digital" button press. Code clean-up completed.
